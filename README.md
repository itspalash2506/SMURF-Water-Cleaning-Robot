# cleanbot
India is holy country & during lots of festival like ganesh visarjan, navratri durga puja & mainly kumbhmela there is lot of water pollution of Godavari River at Nashik. The water pollution is very important problem in rivers, ponds and water bodies near Godavari River at Nashik. Due to increase in water pollution in the form to waste debris; it is hampering the life of aquatic animal and make their life in danger. Similarly sometimes the aquatic animal tends to eats surface waste debris considering it as a food; which ultimately cause the death of animals.

So that to reduce the water pollution we are trying to make river cleaning  machine known as "CLEANBOT‚Äù, a machine which involves the removing the waste debris from water surface and safely dispose from the water body.This machine has designed to clean river water surface. Conventional methods used for collection of floating waste are manual basis or by means of boat, thrash skimmers etc. and deposited near the shore of rivers. These methods are risky, costly and time consuming. By considering all the parameters of river surface cleaning systems and eliminating the drawback of the methods used earlier, the remote operated river cleaning machine has designed which helps in river surface cleaning effectively, efficiently and eco-friendly. The "CLEANBOT" is used where there is waste debris in the water body which are to be removed. This machine consists of DC motors, RF transmitter and receiver, propeller, PVC pipes and chain drive with the conveyor attached to it for collecting wastage, garbage & plastic wastages from water bodies. It is an autonomous river cleaning intelligent robot embedded with artificial intelligence and neural networks. Nowadays almost all the manufacturing process is being automized in order to deliver the products at a faster rate. Automation plays an important role in mass production. In this project we have fabricated the remote operated river cleaning machine. The main aim of the project is to reduce the man power, time consumption for cleaning the river. In this project we have automated the operation of river cleaning with help of a motor and chain drive arrangement.
